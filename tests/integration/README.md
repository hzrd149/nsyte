# Integration Tests

This directory is for integration tests that verify how different components of the application work together.

Integration tests should test complete features or workflows rather than individual units of code.

Currently, there are no integration tests, but they should be added here as needed. Some good candidates for 
integration tests would include:

1. End-to-end tests of CLI commands
2. Tests requiring actual network communication (behind feature flags)
3. Tests that verify multiple components work together correctly
